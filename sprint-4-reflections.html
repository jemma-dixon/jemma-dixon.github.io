                <p>Code Readability is about practising the following habits when you are working on code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indentation/formatting your code to best practice standards.</li>
                    <li>Consistency in how you name things and how you format your code.</li>
                    <li>Naming things well (things like functions and variables) so you can tell what they do or are.
                    </li>
                    <li>Break things into small segments (many small functions compared to one big function).</li>
                    <li>D.R.Y (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself).</li>
                    <li>Commenting a complicated section so people have some idea before reading your code.</li>
                    <li>Not commenting everything or obvious things.</li>
                    <li>Refactoring.</li>
                    <li>Clean code.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="to-make-things-more-concrete-here-are-some-of-my-top-readability-points-">To make things more
                    concrete, here are some of my top readability points:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong><em>Consistency.</em></strong>I can read code with virtually any convention, no problem.
                        I’ve grown to learn to adapt. If I think I need to read code, then I better accept that I may
                        very well read code not written in my favorite style. One thing that is nearly impossible to
                        adapt to, however, is when the code looks like it’s written by a 5 year old who just switched
                        from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY">Qwerty keyboard</a> to <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>.Whatever
                        convention you choose or get forced to use, just stick to it. Make sure it’s what you use
                        <em>everywhere</em> in that project.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>Consistency.</em></strong>There is no way to stress how important this is. People
                        experiment with braces-on-next-line and braces-on-same-line and forget that their experiments
                        end up in the source repository for the frustration of everyone else on the team. Seriously,
                        experimentation is fine. Finding your preferred style is perfectly Ok. Just don’t commit them.
                        Not in the Trunk at least.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Space out the code.</em></strong>Readable code is like readable text. As much as
                        everyone hates reading text-walls, so do developers who have to read sandwiched code. Put empty
                        lines between all scopes. An end-brace is a great place to add that extra line to make it easier
                        to read and find the start of the next scope. Need to comment? Great. Just avoid newspaper-style
                        coding, where the code is turned into a two-column format, code on the left, comments on the
                        right. There are very few cases that one needs to do that. Comments go above the code block or
                        statement, not next to it. Comments are also more readable if they are preceded by a blank line.
                        There is no shortage of disk space. Break long functions, break mega classes and even break long
                        files. Make your functions reasonable in size. Use <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> metrics
                        to know when your code is too complex and hence hard to read and understand. Refactor.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Stop banner-commenting.</em></strong>If you need to add 5 lines of boxed comments
                        within functions, then it’s a good indication you need to start a new function. The banner can
                        go above the new function. As much as I’d rather not have it there either, it’s much better than
                        having a 1000+ lines in a single function with half a dozen banners. After all, if you need to
                        signal the start of a new logical block, functions do that better. Same goes to breaking long
                        functions, classes and files. (Unlike what the image above may imply, that image is just an
                        image of some code, I do not endorse the style it adopts.)</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Don’t use magic numbers.</em></strong>Constants are a great tool to give names to
                        what otherwise is a seemingly magic number that makes the code work. Default values, container
                        limits, timeouts and user-messages are just some examples of good candidates for constants. Just
                        avoid converting every integer into a constant. That’s not the purpose of constants and it
                        reduces code readability.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Choose identifier names wisely.</em></strong>There has been no shortage of
                        literature on naming conventions and the perils of choosing names that lack significant
                        differences. Yet, some still insist on using very ambiguous names and reuse them across logical
                        boundaries. The identifiers not only need to be meaningful and unambiguous, but they also need
                        to be consistent across functions, classes, modules and even the complete project. At least an
                        effort to make them consistent should be made. If you need to use acronyms, then make sure you
                        use the same case convention. Have database or network connections, use the same identifier
                        names everywhere. It’s much, much more readable to see an identifier and immediately know what
                        the type is. Incidentally, this was the <a
                            href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html">original purpose</a> of <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian notation</a> (<a
                            href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260976(v=vs.60">original paper</a>.aspx)).
                        Same goes to function names. ‘<em>Get’</em> can be used for read-only functions that have no
                        side-effects. Avoid using verbs and nouns in an identifier then implement logic that contradicts
                        the natural meaning of those words. It’s downright inhumane. If a functions claims to get some
                        value, then that function should never modify <em>any</em> other value (with the possible
                        exception of updating caches, if any, which should only boost performance without affecting
                        correctness.) Prefer using proper names in identifiers. Meaningful names, nouns and verbs can be
                        a great help, use them to their limit.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Don’t chain declarations.</em></strong>Chaining variable declarations is a very
                        common practice in C. This is partially due to the fact that Ansi C didn’t allow declaring
                        variables after any executable statement. Developers had to declare everything up-front and at
                        the top of their functions. This meant that all the variables of a given type were declared in a
                        chain of commas. Declare variables in the innermost scope possible and as close to the usage
                        statement as possible. Avoid recycling variables, unless it’s for the very same purpose. Never
                        re-purpose variables, instead, declare new ones.A similar practice is sometimes used to chain
                        calls where a single function call which takes one or more arguments is called by first calling
                        other functions and passing their return values as arguments to the first call. These two types
                        of chaining make readability a painful process. Some people chain 3 or 4 function calls within
                        one another, thinking it’s more compact and therefore better, somehow. It’s not. Not when
                        someone needs to scan the code for side-effects and to find a hard bug. A possible exception to
                        this is chaining calls one after another. Some classes are designed to chain calls such that
                        each call returns a reference to the original instance to call other members. This is often done
                        on string and I/O classes. This type of chaining, if not excessively used and too long, can be
                        helpful and improve readability.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Limit line and file lengths.</em></strong>Scrolling horizontally is a huge pain. No
                        one can be reasonably expected to read anything while scrolling left and right for each line.
                        But some people have larger screens than others. Yet some have weaker eye-sight, so use larger
                        fonts. I’ve seen code apparently aligned to 120 characters per line, with occasional 150+
                        characters per line, back when 17″ screens were the norm. Some don’t even care or keep track of
                        line length. This is very unfortunate as it makes other people’s lives very hard, especially
                        those with smaller screens, lower resolutions and large fonts (read: bad eye-sight.) Code can’t
                        be word-wrapped like article text (without the help of advanced editors.)A good starting point
                        is the legacy standard of 80 characters-per-line (cpl). If we can stick to that, great. We
                        should make an effort to minimize the line-length and 80 characters is not too narrow to make
                        things garbled. For teams who can <em>all</em> work with 100 or 120 cpl, the extra line width
                        can give quite a bit flexibility and improve readability. But again be careful because too long
                        a line and readability suffers yet again. Think how newspapers and magazines have narrow columns
                        and how readable they are. Our wide screens with large footprints are like newspapers and moving
                        our heads to read across the line, as opposed to moving just our eyes, is an extra physical
                        strain and certainly a speed bump that we can do without.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Make scopes explicit.</em></strong>Languages often have implicit scopes. The first
                        statement after a conditional or a loop in C-style languages implicitly fall under the
                        conditional or loop, but not consecutive statements. It’s much harder to parse the end of
                        statements using one’s eyeballs to figure out which statement belongs to the implicit scope.
                        Making these cases explicit makes it much easier to see them without much effort. Adding braces
                        and an empty line after the closing brace, even around single-statement scopes does improve
                        readability quite a bit.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Comment.</em></strong>Code is very well understood by machines, even when obsecure
                        and mangled. Humans on the other hand need to understand purpose and reason, beyond seeing what
                        a piece of code would do. Without understanding the reasons behind particular constructs,
                        operations and values, no developer can maintain the code in any sensible way. Comments are a
                        great tool to communicate the less obvious aspects of the code. Explain the business needs,
                        implicit assumptions, workarounds, special-requests and the temporary solutions. Talk to your
                        fellow developers through comments. But, as every rule comes with exceptions, avoid
                        over-commenting at all costs. Resist the temptation to declare that an error is about to occure
                        right before throwing an exception. The throw statement is self-commenting. Don’t repeat
                        yourself. Rather, explain why the case is considered unrecoverable at that point, if it’s not
                        obvious. Prefer to write code that speaks for itself. Self-descriptive code is the most readable
                        code.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>As a corollary, some code <em>should</em> be made hard to read. You read that right</strong>.
                    Code that depends on hacks, bad practices or temporary solutions should be made harder to read.
                    Perhaps my best example is casting. It’s not rare that we need to cast instances of objects to
                    specific types, and while this is a standard practice, it isn’t exactly highly recommended either.
                    Making the casting a little less readable is a good way to force the reader to squint and make sure
                    it’s not a bogus cast. This isn’t unlike italic text which makes reading the text harder and
                    therefore makes it stand out. In the same vein, temporary solutions and hacks should be made to
                    stand out. Adding TODO and FIXME markers are a good start. BUGBUG is another marker for known issues
                    or limitations. Actually, if there is any place for that banner-comment, this would be it. Make
                    known issues stand out like a sore thumb.</p>
                <p>As with most things, the above is mostly a guideline, rules of thumb if you will. They are not set in
                    stone and they aren’t complete by any stretch of imagination. There are many obviously important
                    cases left out. Languages, ecosystems, frameworks and libraries come with their own nuances. What’s
                    clear in one language might be very ambiguous in another, and therefore frowned upon. The important
                    thing is to write with the reader in mind, to avoid confusing styles and especially to be mindful of
                    the context and when an explanatory comment is due, and when refactoring is a better choice.</p>

                <h4 id="-test-driven-development-tdd-"><strong>What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?</strong></h4>
                <p><code>TDD</code> is a particular way of doing code development as a whole. It involves starting with
                    the big picture and writing your tests <em>before</em> you write your code.</p>
                <p>This way of coding means you have to work out what you intend for the code to do and what smaller
                    things need to happen to achieve this before jumping into writing it. Tests are then written that
                    match this intent for your project.</p>
                <p>You don&#39;t need to have written tests for your whole application before you start building, but in
                    a TDD approach you would write the test/s for the next feature or function before you implement it.
                </p>
                <p>Once the test is written, you can then write the code that makes the test pass. Because of this, TDD
                    forgoes writing &quot;nice&quot; code - so long as it works to achieve the needs of the test,
                    you&#39;re on the right track. This also means we can try a number of different methods to achieve
                    the same goal as it doesn&#39;t matter how we get there, just that we do. Once the code works, we
                    then go back and <code>refactor</code> it to make it more concise and readable.</p>
