                <p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Got blocked on a simple problem</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here is an example of a problem I was trying to solve a problem using a For...Of loop:</p>
                <p>Please use a <strong>for...of</strong> loop to loop over an array and print out the square of each
                    value (the number multiplied by itself).</p>
                <p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ** operator is not supported on this platform</li>
                    <li>You could accomplish this by using a while loop or a for loop, but please use a for...of loop!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
<xpm>
    <pre>
    const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]; //DON'T CHANGE THIS LINE PLEASE!

// WRITE YOUR LOOP BELOW THIS LINE:
for ( let number of numbers ){
    console.log(number * number);
}
</pre>
</xpm>


                <p>Originally, I wanted to write it like this: </p>

               
                <xpm>
                    <pre>
                    for(let squaredNums of numbers){
                        console.log(Math.pow(numbers));
            }
                </pre>
            </xpm>

                <p>Since the variable already existing was called &#39;numbers&#39;, then (in terms of singular and
                    plurals) it makes sense to call it <strong><em>number</em></strong> of
                    <strong><em>numbers</em></strong>. Also don&#39;t need to use the Math.() method when you are just
                    squaring (multiplying) a number by itself. Try to keep it simple.
                </p>
                <p>In this example, I think I would have to consider what defines &#39;elegant&#39; code.</p>
                <p><strong>Elegant code uses cleverness to accomplish something in much less code than most people would
                        think possible, but in a way that&#39;s readable and obvious in hindsight and doesn&#39;t look
                        like code golf.</strong></p>
                <p>According to this definition, I would say that the number * number solution is much more elegant than
                    applying the Math.pow method, just because the first solution is more intuitive and appears to be
                    simpler.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</strong></li>
                    <li>I got help and then understood <em>how</em> this solution works.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>In both cases:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What was the problem?</strong></li>
                    <li>My problem is that I&#39;m half-way through a JS course online, so I do have some basic
                        understandings of JS, yet it&#39;s not a Big Picture understanding. I am missing some
                        fundamental key blocks of knowledge, which makes problem solving that much harder under the
                        imposed time constraints. </li>
                    <li>What I&#39;ve been doing: alternating between the Katas on this course and continuing to
                        progress through the JS course I&#39;d taken before starting this bootcamp, so as not to confuse
                        myself. I know once I&#39;ve finished this JS course, I will feel better. </li>
                    <li>Thus, the problem is trying to solve problems without a strong enough foundation - and accepting
                        and navigating that as best as I can, anyway. </li>
                    <li><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></li>
                    <li>Google</li>
                    <li>Continue with the course, talk to peers.</li>

                <h3 id="-pseudocode-from-dev-academy-"><strong>Pseudocode (From Dev Academy)</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Many of the techniques mentioned above can be applied to all sorts of (non-technical)
                            problems, but pseudocode is coding-specific and incredibly useful to help you think through
                            your code.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Pseudocode is not actual code. Rather, <em>pseudocode is composed of comments that
                                    tell you how the code will eventually look.</em></strong> </p>
                        <p> It is informal, plainly written steps that form the rough draft or outline of your code.</p>
                        <p> Pseudocoding involves taking a little time before you get into writing the code to break
                            down your plan into small steps. This means you don&#39;t have to worry about making the
                            whole thing work at once, but can instead focus on just coding one step at a time. This can
                            be useful for helping you break down a complicated problem, but can also be used if one
                            developer needs to leave instructions for another to complete the code later.</p>
                        <p> Because pseudocode is the steps rather than the code itself, you don&#39;t need to include
                            the fine details of what needs to happen. It&#39;s a bit like recalling a recipe you know,
                            you don&#39;t need all the details immediately, you just need to know the ingredients needed
                            and can work the rest out when you get to it. For example, to make brownies:</p>

                      
                                <xpm>
                                    <pre>
                                    // put butter, sugar, and cocoa in bowl and then microwave
                                    // add eggs and vanilla and mix through
                                    // add flour and mix until thick
                                    // bake!
                                
                                </pre>
                            </xpm>


                        <p> You can see that we didn&#39;t include any details, just general steps.</p>
                        <p> Once you have written pseudocode, you may find you need to change the order of steps, or you
                            might discover that you have forgotten some and need to add them in - and that&#39;s okay!
                            This is only a first draft and it will inevitably change as you come to write the code
                            itself.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Another simplified definition of Pseudocode:</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Ps<em>eu</em>docode is just any representation of code that isn&#39;t actually code (<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-">the pseudo prefix</a> makes words like that)
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>So for example, while I might say the following in code...</p>
                
               
                    <xpm>
                        <pre>
                        for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                            console.log(i);
                          }
                        </pre>
                    </xpm>
                    

                <p>We could also express it in more human-readable pseudocode...</p>

                <xpm>
                    <pre>
                loop from 0 to 10
                print loop index
            </pre>
        </xpm>

                <p>There is no specific syntax for pseudocode, it literally can be anything you want.</p>
