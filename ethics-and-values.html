                    </li>
                    <p><strong>Advocate Information</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They have a deep sense of idealism and integrity, but they aren’t idle dreamers – they take
                            concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact.</li>
                        <li>Advocates’ unique combination of personality traits makes them complex and quite versatile.
                            For example, Advocates can speak with great passion and conviction, especially when standing
                            up for their ideals. At other times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and
                            understated, preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge others.</li>
                        <li>Advocates generally strive to do what’s right – and they want to help create a world where
                            others do the right thing as well. People with this personality type may feel called to use
                            t<strong>heir strengths – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift
                                others and spread compassion.</strong> Concepts like egalitarianism and karma can mean a
                            great deal to Advocates.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Advocates may see helping others as their purpose in life. They are troubled by
                                injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. As a result,
                                Advocates tend to step in when they see someone facing unfairness or hardship. Many
                                people with this personality type also aspire to fix society’s deeper problems, in the
                                hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><em>Nothing lights up Advocates like creating a solution that changes people’s
                                        lives.</em></p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Strengths</strong> </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Creative</strong> – Advocate personalities enjoy finding the perfect solution for
                            the people they care about. To do this, they draw on their vivid imagination and their
                            strong sense of compassion. This can make them excellent counselors and advisors.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Insightful</strong> – Advocates typically strive to move past appearances and get to
                            the heart of things. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s
                            true motivations, feelings, and needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Principled</strong> – People with the Advocate personality type tend to have deeply
                            held beliefs, and their conviction often shines through when they speak or write about
                            subjects that matter to them. Advocates can be compelling and inspiring communicators, with
                            their idealism persuading even the hardest of skeptics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Passionate</strong> – Advocates can pursue their ideals with a single-mindedness
                            that may catch others off guard. These personalities rarely settle for “good enough,” and
                            their willingness to disrupt the status quo may not please everyone. That said, Advocates’
                            passion for their chosen cause is a key aspect of their personality.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Altruistic</strong> – Advocates generally aim to use their strengths for the
                                greater good – they rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They tend to
                                think about how their actions affect others, and their goal is to behave in a way that
                                will help the people around them and make the world a better place.</p>
                            <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Sensitive to Criticism</strong> – When someone challenges their principles or
                            values, Advocates may react strongly. People with this personality type can become defensive
                            in the face of criticism and conflict, particularly when it comes to issues that are near to
                            their hearts.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Reluctant to Open Up</strong> – Advocates value honesty, but they’re also private.
                            They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles. This might
                            also be because they think they need to solve their problems on their own or don’t want to
                            burden other people with their issues. When Advocates don’t ask for help, they may
                            inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfectionistic</strong> – The Advocate personality type is all but defined by
                            idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, an ideal situation is not always
                            possible. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or
                            relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they
                            should be looking for something better.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoiding the Ordinary</strong> – Advocate personalities tend to be motivated by a
                            sense of having a greater purpose in life. They might consider it tedious or unnecessary to
                            break their big visions into small, manageable steps. But they may be setting themselves up
                            for frustration if they don’t turn their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists.
                            Without these specifics, their goals may never materialize.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Prone to Burnout</strong> – Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve may leave them
                                with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust
                                themselves if they don’t find a way to balance their drive to help others with necessary
                                self-care and rest.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><em>One of the things Advocates find most important is establishing genuine, deep
                                        connections with the people they care about.</em></p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>Just as Advocates have high standards for themselves, they also have high standards for
                            their friendships. They want to feel compatible with their friends on a deep level. In
                            addition, Advocate personalities generally want to surround themselves with people who will
                            inspire them to grow and improve. Most Advocates don’t just want to have fun with their
                            friends – they also want to learn new things, make new discoveries, and deepen their bonds.
                        </li>
                        <li>In their quiet, understated way, Advocate personality types have a knack for seeing beyond
                            appearances and understanding people’s deeper natures. They can use this ability to move
                            past first impressions and figure out whether someone’s interests, values, and attitudes
                            might be compatible with their own. By doing this, Advocates can befriend people who might
                            seem totally different from them but who are compatible on a deeper level.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Advocates may sometimes find themselves surrounded by people who want to impress them.
                                Paradoxically, this can make it more difficult for people with this personality type to
                                find friends with whom they feel a connection. After all, the only way to be counted
                                among Advocates’ true friends is to be authentic, honest, and real.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><em>“It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging,
                                        adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, ’I don’t want to try because I may not
                                        succeed completely.’”—</em> JIMMY CARTER</p>
                                <p><em>For Advocates, money and Employee of the Month simply won’t cut it. These

                    pavement in the rain. I offered him a banana. He told me he didn&#39;t want a banana; he needed a
                    blanket and a raincoat. I told him I was sorry, and I wish I could help. I drove back to my
                    accommodation in the city; I remembered that an international student had just left about a week
                    ago, and she had left her duvet, pillows, and sheets. I drove back to the supermarket and thankfully
                    he was still there. I feel guilty whenever I pass someone in the street and don&#39;t help them,
                    especially when I don&#39;t think twice about how we use and discard valuable resources. He thanked
                    me for the pillows, the duvet, and the plastic bag. I sat in my car and cried as I drove home. I
                    think about how &quot;social justice is love applied to systems, policies, and cultures,&quot; and
                    how the consequences of my actions might not have been enough, but at least it was something. Dr.
                    Sue Johnson writes &quot;<em>Nothing grows people like love. When we are loved, we blossom. The
                        message of evolution is not the survival of the fittest. The message of evolution is the
                        survival of the most nurtured.&quot;</em>

                <p>This answer merits more than what I write here. Since culture is complex and because I have visited
                    and lived in different places and cultures at different times of my life, and because reading
                    material or watching films or listening to music and engaging with people is a facet of interacting
                    with culture, and because we are embedded within a culture that is sometimes hard to &#39;see
                    through,&#39; an answer giving real justice to this question would be too long, and perhaps
                    impossible to produce. </p>

                    In my own experience, I recall suggesting an idea to a group at uni. Another person then repeated
                    the exact idea
                    for which they took credit. Which isn't - in terms of work goals and outcomes - a huge deal, but it
                    is frustrating and unethical, regardless of gender.

                <h2><strong>A Few Strategies: Excerpts from Masha - Stereotype Breakers</strong></h2>
                <p>"I know many awesome men who want to support diversity and in particular women in tech. But some
                    don’t know where to start. Some say they don’t know how to approach it or they’re afraid to do or
                    say the wrong thing. It can be hard to navigate being an advocate or an ally. So, I’ve decided to
                    create this post specifically for those men.

                    Diversity in tech is everyone’s issue – because without it we cannot create truly innovative
                    technology that solves problems. We know that diversity brings countless benefits to organisations
                    improving. For example, it helps with financial growth, company performance, company culture,
                    creativity, the product itself, customer satisfaction and so on. I’ll link some articles at the
                    bottom of this post if you want to learn more about it!" </p>
                <p>We all know that there are a ton of super talented and skilled women in tech out there. And this
                    isn’t a competition, we are all on the same side. We all want to thrive at work and make a
                    difference and the most effective way to achieve that is by doing it all together. However, there
                    are systemic issues and biases that create barriers for women when entering the industry and growing
                    within it.

                    These systems developed over time representing the needs of the majority group (white men). They are
                    now disadvantaging employees for whom this environment wasn’t designed for. Change requires
                    everyone’s input. In fact, men in tech are often in a better position to influence these dynamics
                    compared to most women because they’re the majority demographic. It’s mens’ responsibility to help
                    support women.

                    Now that we know why men should be allies, let’s talk about how they can do that. </p>

                <p><strong>1. Listen to women </strong>
                    Listen to women’s stories and try to understand their experiences. Don’t try to “fix” individual
                    women, but understand what barriers they’re facing in their environment. Practice your active
                    listening skills and be open-minded. To make sure we’re on the same page, active listening isn’t
                    waiting for your turn to express your opinion. Active listening involves hearing and properly
                    processing the information you hear.

                    National Center for Women and Information Technology has created a very helpful Critical Listening
                    Guide. It warns of certain traps and helps with finding language that will enable you to have a very
                    meaningful conversation.

                    Some of the things that will be helpful to understand as a result of such conversations are:

                    What privilege is and think of examples of how you may have benefited from it in your career.
                    Understanding it is an important step to becoming an ally!

                    That gender inequality comes in different shapes and forms.

                    How the environment is still biased and what barriers women face when advancing their careers in
                    technology. </p>
