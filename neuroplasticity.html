                        â€œThe modern fascination with neuroplasticity has led many to try to optimize their intelligence,
                        memory, and concentration. People obsessively track and optimize their sleep, nutrition, and
                        exercise regimens.
                        But people who obsessively and directly optimize the structure of their minds for flourishing
                        are less common." <br>

                <p><strong><a href="http://neuroscience.centreforbrainhealth.ca/boyd-lara/">Dr.Lara Boyd</a></strong> is
                    a Neuroscientist and Physical Therapist at the University of British Columbia. She is a professor
                    and expert in mapping how behaviors, environments, and experiences affect brain health and learning.
                    Dr.Boyd explains how &quot;what we know about the brain is changing at a breathtaking pace.&quot;
                    Whereas it was once believed that after childhood the brain could not change, it turns out that
                    &quot;nothing could be farther from the truth.&quot; Boyd discusses misconceptions about the brain
                    and encourages us to go out and change our brains by changing our behaviors for the better.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong><em>&quot;Everything you do, everything you encounter and everything you experience is
                                changing your brain...The ensuing research has shown us that all of our behaviors change
                                our brain, they&#39;re not limited by age, and it&#39;s happening all the
                                time.&quot;</em></strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As Theodore Zeldin writes, &quot;The kind of conversation I like is one in which you are prepared to
                    emerge a slightly different person.&quot; I like to think about this quote in terms of non-human
                    conversation. What kinds of engagements and &#39;conversations&#39; do we have with instruments like
                    the guitar, or with books, and life?</p>

                <h3 id="-1-increase-chemical-signalling-"><strong>1. Increase Chemical Signalling</strong></h3>
                <p>The brain actually functions by transferring chemical signals between brain cells, what we call
                    neurons, and this triggers a series of actions and reactions. So, <em>to support learning, your
                        brain can increase the concentration of the chemical signaling thatâ€™s taking place between
                        neurons.</em> Now, because this kind of change can happen rapidly, this supports short-term
                    memory or the short-term improvement in the performance of a motor skill. </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong><em>&quot;One thing is absolutely clear: the best driver of neuroplastic change in your
                                brain is your behavior... the primary driver of change in your brain is your behavior,
                                so there&#39;s no neuroplasticity drug you can take. Nothing is more effective than
                                practice at helping you learn, and the bottom line is, you have to do the
                                work.&quot;</em></strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boyd&#39;s research has shown that increased difficulty, increased struggle - if you will -
                        during practice, actually leads to more learning and greater structural change in the brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>The brain is being shaped structurally and functionally by everything you do, and also
                        everything else you <em>don&#39;t</em> do.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong><em>&quot;You and your plastic brain are constantly being shaped by the world around
                                you... So when you leave today, go out and build the brain you want.&quot;</em></strong>

                <p>This is also a fascinating talk. I was particularly interested in learning about
                    <strong>focused</strong> and <strong>diffused</strong> modes of thinking. The information can apply
                    to anything from learning how to code, to solving a math equation, writing poetry, or playing an
                    instrument.</p>
