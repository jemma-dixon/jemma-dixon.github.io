                    <p>&quot;Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better?
                        Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just
                        shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out
                        the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching
                        yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it‚Äôs not going well, is the hallmark of
                        the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most
                        challenging times in their lives.&quot; ‚Äî Carol Dweck, Fixed vs. Growth</p>

                            <li>A growing body of research supports the role that neuroplasticity plays in learning. The
                                ability of the brain to reconfigure makes the acquirement of new information and new
                                skills possible. The brain must be impacted by this new information in order to learn
                                it: the nature of learning is that we change through experience.</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that anatomical changes take place in the brains
                                    of those learning a second language. These results show neuroplasticity at work,
                                    changing the structure of the brain to allow for learning to take place.</p>

                            <p>‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to
                                consolidate those memories, even if you get lots of ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù sleep thereafter. In
                                terms of memory, then, sleep is not like the bank. You cannot accumulate a debt and hope
                                to pay it off at a later point in time. Sleep for memory consolidation is an

                        <p> Your brain needs sleep to reset brain connections that are important for memory and
                            learning. Just one night of losing sleep impedes the brain‚Äôs ability to reset itself, which
                            impairs your memory. For adults 26 to 64 years old, the National Sleep Foundation recommends
                            7 to 9 hours of sleep per day.</p>

                        <p> Whether it‚Äôs learning a new language or a type of dance, the process of learning something
                            new improves brain plasticity. Learning and practising a new language has been found to
                            strengthen the brain. You can also learn a musical instrument or an art skill.</p>
                        <p> The brain benefits from learning the way your body benefits from exercise. One study reveals
                            that ‚Äúthe brains of the successful learners had undergone functional changes ‚Äî the brain
                            network was better integrated.‚Äù</p>
                        <p> But exercise itself is also beneficial to the brain. Cardiovascular exercises boost oxygen
                            supply to the brain and increase brain volume. The Department of Health and Human Services
                            recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous
                            aerobic exercise per week.</p>

                        <p> Stress is a silent killer, and it also diminishes neuroplasticity. If you can‚Äôt reduce the
                            sources of stress in your life, you can change how you respond to it. An excellent way to
                            de-stress is to surround yourself with nature or to travel. Meditation is another way to
                            control your stress responses.</p>

                            Change Your Life says that brain change will be more significant if you‚Äôre motivated and

                            <li>&quot;True self-confidence is ‚Äúthe courage to be open‚Äîto welcome change and new ideas
                                regardless of their source.‚Äù Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an
                                expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your
                                mindset: your readiness to grow.&quot;</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Are there ways you could be less defensive about your mistakes? Could you profit more
                                    from the feedback you get? Are there ways you can create more learning experiences
                                    for yourself?</p>

                            <li>
                                Think about your hero. Do you think of this person as someone with extraordinary
                                abilities who achieved with little effort? Now go find out the truth Find out the
                                tremendous effort that went into their accomplishment--and admire them
                                <em>more.</em>

                            <li>Think of times other people outdid you and you just assumed they were smarter or more
                                talented. Now consider the idea that they just used better strategies, taught themselves
                                more, practiced harder, and worked their way through obstacles. You can do that, too, if
                                you want to.</li>
                            <li>Are there situations where you get stupid--where you disengage your intelligence? Next
                                time you‚Äôre in one of those situations, get yourself into a growth mindset--think about
                                learning and improvement, not judgment--and hook it back up.</li>
                            <li>Do you label your kids? <em>This one is the artist and that one is the scientist.</em>
                                Next time, remember that you‚Äôre not helping them--even though you may be praising them.
                                Remember our study where praising kids‚Äô ability lowered their IQ scores. Find a
                                growth-mindset way to compliment them.</li>
                            <li>More than half of our society belongs to a negatively stereotyped group. First you have
                                all the women, and then you have all the other groups who are not supposed to be good at
                                something or other. Give them the gift of the growth mindset. Create an environment that
                                teaches the growth mindset to the adults and children in your life, especially the ones
                                who are targets of negative stereotypes. Even when the negative label comes along,
                                they‚Äôll remain in charge of their learning.</li>

                                    learning new things. Before that I said &quot;If I&#39;m doing it, I should do it
                                    perfectly&quot; and I just failed at getting any better. But once I shifted my
                                    mindset,
                                    it was all suddenly a lot easier to get healthy, work out, learn a new language,
                                    etc.

                <p><strong><a href="http://neuroscience.centreforbrainhealth.ca/boyd-lara/">Dr.Lara Boyd</a></strong> is
                    a Neuroscientist and Physical Therapist at the University of British Columbia. She is a professor
                    and expert in mapping how behaviors, environments, and experiences affect brain health and learning.
                    Dr.Boyd explains how &quot;what we know about the brain is changing at a breathtaking pace.&quot;
                    Whereas it was once believed that after childhood the brain could not change, it turns out that
                    &quot;nothing could be farther from the truth.&quot; Boyd discusses misconceptions about the brain
                    and encourages us to go out and change our brains by changing our behaviors for the better.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong><em>&quot;Everything you do, everything you encounter and everything you experience is
                                changing your brain...The ensuing research has shown us that all of our behaviors change
                                our brain, they&#39;re not limited by age, and it&#39;s happening all the
                                time.&quot;</em></strong></p>

                <p>As Theodore Zeldin writes, &quot;The kind of conversation I like is one in which you are prepared to
                    emerge a slightly different person.&quot; I like to think about this quote in terms of non-human
                    conversation. What kinds of engagements and &#39;conversations&#39; do we have with instruments like
                    the guitar, or with books, and life?</p>

                <p>The brain actually functions by transferring chemical signals between brain cells, what we call
                    neurons, and this triggers a series of actions and reactions. So, <em>to support learning, your
                        brain can increase the concentration of the chemical signaling that‚Äôs taking place between
                        neurons.</em> Now, because this kind of change can happen rapidly, this supports short-term
                    memory or the short-term improvement in the performance of a motor skill. </p>

                                so there&#39;s no neuroplasticity drug you can take. Nothing is more effective than
                                practice at helping you learn, and the bottom line is, you have to do the

                        during practice, actually leads to more learning and greater structural change in the brain.

                <p>This is also a fascinating talk. I was particularly interested in learning about
                    <strong>focused</strong> and <strong>diffused</strong> modes of thinking. The information can apply
                    to anything from learning how to code, to solving a math equation, writing poetry, or playing an
