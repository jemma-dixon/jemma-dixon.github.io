                    <li>I can read pretty quickly and learn/get through content relatively quickly.</li>

                    <li>A mistake I can make is waiting until I feel ready to start.</li>
                    <li>I can spend too much time on things that have less of an impact in terms of long-term goals, so
                        I constantly need to evaluate where my time is best spent, yet also trust that I might not
                        always be right - trust the process.</li>
